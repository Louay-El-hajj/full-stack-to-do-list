Remember the todo lost website you created in week 1? It’s time to link it!

Create and link the following APIs for a todo list website:
Create / Read / Update / Delete todo.
Login / Signup.
Note that:
The user can login using email or username
A user might have several todos, a todo can be owned by one user only.
The user can complete todos, which will increment the user’s score.
Deliverable: NEW repository containing BOTH the backend folder and the frontend folder. (You are free to use your previous todo website’s frotend or start from scratch).
